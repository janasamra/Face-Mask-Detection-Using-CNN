# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN
Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to develop a face mask detection system using CNNs. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can train a model to accurately classify images of pepole into wearing mask or no mask categories based on visual symptoms. The model will learn to extract relevant features from the images and make predictions
